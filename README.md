# 💳 Credit Risk Probability Model

This repository provides a comprehensive, machine learning-based solution for predicting the probability of credit risk. The goal is to help financial institutions assess the likelihood of default for loan applicants, supporting better risk management and informed decision-making.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- **Transparent Credit Risk Assessment:** Deliver interpretable models that meet regulatory requirements and support business decisions.
- **Flexible Modeling Pipeline:** Enable experimentation with various machine learning algorithms and feature engineering techniques.
- **End-to-End Workflow:** Provide scripts and notebooks for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## 💼 Business Understanding

### Basel II Accord & Interpretability

The Basel II Capital Accord emphasizes the need for accurate, transparent risk quantification to ensure financial system stability. Credit scoring models must be both predictive and interpretable, allowing institutions to justify decisions to regulators. Techniques like Weight of Evidence (WoE) and Information Value (IV) enhance explainability while quantifying risk.

### Proxy Variable for Default

If the dataset lacks an explicit "default" indicator, a proxy variable is constructed using Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) metrics. This binary target assumes customers with low transaction activity and value are more likely to default. While this enables modeling without ground-truth labels, it introduces potential misclassification risk. Regular documentation and recalibration of the proxy are essential.

### Model Complexity vs. Simplicity

There is a trade-off between interpretability and predictive performance. Logistic regression models with WoE encoding offer simplicity and transparency, suitable for regulatory audits. More complex models (e.g., gradient boosting machines) may improve accuracy but reduce interpretability. Model choice should balance explainability and performance.

## ✨ Features

- Model evaluation and comparison
- Probability scoring for individual applicants
- Configurable pipeline for experimentation

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit_risk_probability_model.git
    cd credit_risk_probability_model
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 🚀 Usage

1. Prepare your dataset in CSV format.
2. Edit the configuration file (`config.yaml`) as needed.
3. Train the model:
    ```bash
    python train.py --config config.yaml
    ```
4. Predict credit risk probabilities:
    ```bash
    python predict.py --input applicant_data.csv --model saved_model.pkl
    ```

## 📁 Data Requirements

The model expects a tabular dataset with features such as:

- Applicant demographics (age, income, employment status)
- Credit history (previous defaults, credit score)
- Loan details (amount, term, purpose)

**Note:** Ensure data privacy and compliance with relevant regulations.

## 🔬 Modeling Approach

- Data cleaning and imputation
- Feature selection and transformation
- Model training with cross-validation
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Probability calibration

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
