# Credit Risk Probability Model

This project provides a machine learning-based solution for predicting the probability of credit risk. It is designed to help financial institutions assess the likelihood of default for loan applicants, enabling better risk management and decision-making.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering for credit datasets
- Multiple machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Probability scoring for individual applicants
- Configurable pipeline for experimentation

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit_risk_probability_model.git
    cd credit_risk_probability_model
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset in CSV format.
2. Edit the configuration file as needed.
3. Run the training script:
    ```bash
    python train.py --config config.yaml
    ```
4. Predict credit risk probabilities:
    ```bash
    python predict.py --input applicant_data.csv --model saved_model.pkl
    ```

## Data

The model expects a tabular dataset with features such as:

- Applicant demographics (age, income, employment status)
- Credit history (previous defaults, credit score)
- Loan details (amount, term, purpose)

**Note:** Ensure data privacy and compliance with relevant regulations.

## Modeling Approach

- Data cleaning and imputation
- Feature selection and transformation
- Model training with cross-validation
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Probability calibration

## Evaluation Metrics

- Area Under ROC Curve (AUC-ROC)
- Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Brier Score
- Confusion Matrix
